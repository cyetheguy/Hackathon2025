Project Name: Recline and Refute

What is the most relaxing thing you can think of? Debate is probably close to the bottom of that list. Well with Recline and Refute, you can have a heated debate with other users, and then get your zen on with the relaxation and meditation assisting features.

Enjoy stronger light and dark theming than usual with corresponding sounds to further create a relaxing ambience
