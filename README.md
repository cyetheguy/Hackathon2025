Team Name: Team SUWY
Project Name: Recline and Refute

What's the least relaxing thing you can think of? Debate is probably close to the top of that list. Well with Recline and Refute, you can have a heated debate with other user's about any topic as you try to refute their claims, and then get your zen on with the relaxation and meditation assisting screen.
